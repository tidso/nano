 SYSTEM = Silicon (Diamond) - Band

start parameters for this Run
 ISTART = 0 ! job: 0-new  1- orbitals from WAVECAR
 ICHARG = 11 ! Read CHGCAR file from geometric relaxation run

other parameters
 LORBIT = 12
 LCHARG = .TRUE. ! Writes CHGCAR
  ISPIN = 2 ! spin-polarized calculation
   PREC = Normal

electronic optimization
  ENCUT = 500.0 ! defaults from POTCAR, but wise to include
   ALGO = Normal ! alorithm for electron optimization (Normal: Davidson)
   NELM = 100 ! of ELM steps, sometimes default is too small
  EDIFF = 1.0e-05 ! stopping-criterion for ELM
  SIGMA = 0.05
 ISMEAR = 0 ! =0 with SIGMA = 0.05 is a good guess for semiconductors/insulators if you are unsure

ionic relaxation
 EDIFFG = -0.01 ! stopping-criterion for IOM (all forces smaller 1E-2)
    NSW = 0 ! ionic steps
   ISIF = 3 ! Full Geometric Relaxation
 IBRION = 2 ! use the conjugate-gradient algorithm
